Hi, I am PhD student in the [Department of Civil and Systems Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), advised by Professor [Lauren Gardner](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/lauren-gardner/). I am also a member of the Center for Systems Science and Engineering ([CSSE](https://systems.jhu.edu/)) and the Infectious Disease Dynamics Groups ([IDD](https://www.iddynamics.jhsph.edu/)).

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Hi, I am Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Civil and Systems Engineering](https://engineering.jhu.edu/case/) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), advised by Professor [Lauren Gardner](https://engineering.jhu.edu/faculty/lauren-gardner/). I am also a member of the Center for Systems Science and Engineering ([CSSE](https://systems.jhu.edu/)) and the Infectious Disease Dynamics Groups ([IDD](https://www.iddynamics.jhsph.edu/)). Before joining Johns Hopkins, I earned my Master's degree in Industrial Engineering from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) and completed my undergraduate studies at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) and [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm). 

**I am currently active in the 2024-2025 academic job market, seeking a tenure-track faculty position.**

Research Interest
======
The spread of infectious diseases is not merely a biological phenomenon but a complex interplay of biological, social, and environmental factors. This complexity and the multidisciplinary nature of disease spread underscore the crucial need for engineers with domain knowledge in Public Health to approach these challenges from a system-level perspective. Recognizing this imperative, my research has evolved to bridge the fields of **Systems Engineering** and **Public Health**, where I develop cutting-edge **computational and AI-driven methods** to tackle broader societal challenges, particularly in the realm of Public Health. Specifically, my work focuses on: 
<ul>
  <li>Data-Driven Decision Making</li>
  <li>Multimodal Machine Learning for Public Health</li>
  <li>Modeling Human Behavior in Complex Systems</li>
</ul>

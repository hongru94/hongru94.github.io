## Pandemic surveillance

I am honored to have worked with the JHU COVID-19 Dashboard team to advance pandemic surveillance and data democratization, creating essential data resources to support global decision-making.

## Infectious disease forecasting
I develop data-driven methods for real-time infectious disease forecasting, including COVID-19, influenza, and RSV.

I am currently contributing to the CDC's weekly infectious disease forecasting submissions.

## Retrospective risk factor analysis
I also focus on retrospective risk factor analysis to identify key drivers of disease outcomes and inform targeted public health interventions.
